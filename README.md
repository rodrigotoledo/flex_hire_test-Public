Welcome to the Flexhire Prototype Application! This application is designed to help you showcase your technical skills while working with the Flexhire API. 

## Goals of this Code Test

At Flexhire, we use a specific tech stack, and we want to assess your proficiency in working with it. Additionally, we want to see how you approach working with an unfamiliar API and product. If you have any technical questions or need clarification during the code test, feel free to reach out to us.

## What You Will Be Building

You have the option to focus on either the frontend or backend, but we prefer full-stack engineers who can tackle both aspects of the project.

### Frontend

As a frontend engineer, your task is to build a small prototype frontend application that utilizes the Flexhire API. Your application should include one or more of the following pages:

1. **Profile Page**
   - Must display your name, avatar, and industry at a minimum.
   - Ideally, showcase your skills with experience numbers.
   - Ideally, display your video answers.
   - Feel free to explore additional data available in the API.

2. **Jobs Page**
   - Display your job applications and their status.
   - For each job application:
     - Show the name of the hiring manager and the company.
     - Show the job title.
     - Ideally, display the contract requests (screening questions and code test) and their answers.
     - Explore additional data from the API if you'd like.

We are not looking for a mere copy of our website. Instead, we want to see your unique perspective on the User Experience (UX) and aesthetics of Flexhire.
